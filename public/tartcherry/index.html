    <h2>Tart cherry juice has gained attention for its potential to boost melatonin levels, a hormone crucial for regulating sleep-wake cycles.</h2>
    <h2>A study conducted on the effects of screen time on melatonin levels suggests a correlation between prolonged exposure to electronic screens and a reduction in melatonin production.</h2>
    <h2> The blue light emitted by screens, especially in the evening, has been found to suppress melatonin release, potentially leading to disruptions in the circadian rhythm and sleep disturbances.</h2>
    <h2>The study's findings suggest that tart cherry juice may be a helpful way to protect the body from the harmful effects of EMFs.</h2>
    <h2>Incorporating tart cherry juice into one's diet may offer a natural remedy, as it contains melatonin and other sleep-promoting compounds.</h2>
    <h2>The antioxidants and phytochemicals present in tart cherries are believed to support melatonin synthesis and contribute to improved sleep quality.</h2> 
    <h2>It is best to buy fresh tart cherry juice and not from concentrate for higher melatonin content.</h2>
