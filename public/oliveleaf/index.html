    <h3>Olive leaf tea may offer protection against the harmful effects of WiFi and electromagnetic fields (EMFs).</h3>
    <h3>In the study, rats were exposed to high levels of EMFs for a period of two weeks.</h3>
    <h3>The results showed that the rats that drank olive leaf tea had significantly less damage to their cells than the rats that did not.</h3> 
    <h3>The study's findings suggest that olive leaf tea may be a helpful way to protect the body from the harmful effects of EMFs.</h3>
    
    <h3>Here's a simple recipe for making olive leaf tea:</h3>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        
    <h3>1 tablespoon dried olive leaves (or 2 tablespoons fresh leaves)</h3>
    <h3>1 to 2 cups of water</h3>
    <h3>Optional: honey, lemon, or mint for flavor</h3>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        
    <h3>Harvesting or Obtaining Olive Leaves:</h3>
        
    <h3>If you have access to an olive tree, you can harvest fresh leaves. Make sure they are clean and free from pesticides.</h3>
    <h3> If using dried leaves, you can purchase them from a health food store or online.</h3>
    <h3>Preparing the Leaves:</h3>
        
    <h3>If using fresh leaves, rinse them thoroughly under cold water to remove any dirt or debris.</h3>
    <h3>If using dried leaves, no additional preparation is necessary.</h3>
    <h3>Boiling Water:</h3>
        
    <h3>Bring 1 to 2 cups of water to a boil. The amount of water depends on how strong you want your tea.</h3>
    <h3>Adding Olive Leaves:</h3>
        
    <h3>Place the olive leaves in a teapot or directly into the boiling water.</h3>
    <h3>Steeping:</h3>
        
    <h3>Allow the leaves to steep in the hot water for about 5 to 10 minutes. You can adjust the steeping time based on your preference for a stronger or milder flavor.</h3>
    <h3>Straining:</h3>
        
    <h3>After steeping, strain the tea to remove the olive leaves. You can use a fine mesh strainer or a tea infuser.</h3>
    <h3>Optional Additions:</h3>
        
    <h3>If desired, add honey, lemon, or mint to enhance the flavor of your olive leaf tea.</h3>
    <h3>Serve:
        
    <h3>Pour the tea into a cup and enjoy. You can drink it hot or let it cool for iced tea.</h3>
    <h3> Note:</h3>
        
    <h3>It's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional before incorporating new herbal teas into your routine, especially if you have any existing health conditions or are pregnant.</h3>
    <h3>Remember that the taste and strength of the tea may vary based on the quality and type of olive leaves you use. Adjust the quantities and steeping time according to your preferences.</h3>
